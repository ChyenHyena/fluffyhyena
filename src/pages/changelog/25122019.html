		<p>After an entire year of absence thanks to life, I'm back and finishing stuff.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Entire site is now mobile and small-screen friendly.</li>
			<li>Fixed front page and storage links.</li>
			<li>Added different backgrounds, mascots and buttons to each section.</li>
			<li>Greatly improved accessibility.</li>
			<li>Removed "under construction" placeholders.</li>
			<li>Moved the "log"'s CSS to its own sheet.</li>
			<li>Moved javascript to its own section.</li>
			<li>Added links and lists of links to the "links" section. Links links links links links.</li>
			<li>Added an "images" section to storage.</li>
			<li>And a gazillion more of different tweaks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It was a ton of work but I'm quite happy with the results. Still a lot to do, so expect:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A complete overhaul of the "blog" section.</li>
			<li>A different CSS style for the "storage" and "links" sections.</li>
			<li>A less-barren front and art pages.</li>
			<li>Revamping the CSS to use the grid standard.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Hopefully 2020 will see a more user-friendly site with all the accesibility and responsive features necessary. Happy new year!</p>
